===== Engine View

footnote:[asciidoc source of this page:  https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio-modeldebugging/framework/execution_framework/plugins/org.eclipse.gemoc.executionframework.ui/docs/asciidoc/user_mw_EngineView.asciidoc.]


The engine view displays a list of execution engines and their status:

* current running status (Green = Running, Red = Stopped),
* number of steps that have been executed.

NOTE: The number of executed step shows only the steps that have finished. Ie. It is increased on step end. This 
means that in case of *Step into* nested calls, this number will increases only when it has finished the inner step. 

NOTE: <<userguide-mw-timelines-view, Timelines>> may choose to use they own step numbering and it may not be the same as the 
_number of steps_ of this Engine view. 

In <<img-simple-engine-view>>, the buttons available on the top right of this view respectively allow to:

* Stop the selected engine (red square button)
* Remove/dispose the selected engine  from the view (cross button) (the engine must be stopped)
* Remove/dispose all previously stopped engines from the view (crosses button)

NOTE: The Sirius diagram are not closed when the execution ends, they are closed only when the engine is disposed.

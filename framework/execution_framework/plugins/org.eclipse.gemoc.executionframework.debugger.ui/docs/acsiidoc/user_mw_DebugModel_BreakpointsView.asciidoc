This view is available on the Debug perspective.

It displays all the breakpoints that have been set for the current execution.

In <<mw-debug-view-figure>>, the breakpoints listed are ModelElement breakpoints that are linked to model elements in the model 
(2 States and 1 Transition from <<K3FSM-example, K3FSM example>>).
During a model execution in Debug mode, if a DSA is called on one of the elements listed here, then the execution will be suspended.

Note that setting the breakpoints is usually done using <<userguide-mw-editor-debug-integration>>.

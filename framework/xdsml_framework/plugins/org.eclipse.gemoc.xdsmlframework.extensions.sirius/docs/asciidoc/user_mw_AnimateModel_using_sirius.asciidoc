==== Animate a model using representation provided by Sirius
footnote:[asciidoc source of this page:  https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio-modeldebugging/tree/master/framework/xdsml_framework/plugins/org.eclipse.gemoc.xdsmlframework.extensions.sirius/docs/asciidoc/user_mw_AnimateModel_using_sirius.asciidoc.]

If the language provides some animation provided by Sirius (see <<define-sirus-animation-representation-section>>),
then the activation is done via the enabling of dedicated layers.

[NOTE]
====
If the animation service class has been properly configured, then the declared layers will be enabled 
by default when starting a model execution.  

Otherwise, the user may have to enable the layers manually.
====

Manual enabling/disabling of a layer is usually done by selecting the background of the diagram and then click in the layer
drop down command as shown in <<img-manual_enabling_of_sirius_layer>>.

When running, a typical animated visualization of the execution data could be as in 
<<img_fsm-simple-sirius-animation>>. In this FSM language, 
the current state is decorated with a green arrow and a new box shows the buffer content
 as defined by the language designer in <<defining-a-debug-representation-section>>.

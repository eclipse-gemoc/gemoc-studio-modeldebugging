==== Define a debug representation and commands for Sirius

footnote:[asciidoc source of this page:  https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio-modeldebugging/tree/master/simulationmodelanimation/plugins/org.eclipse.gemoc.dsl.debug.ide.sirius.ui/docs/asciidoc/user_lw_DefineSiriusDebug.asciidoc.]

The debug layer is an extension on top of a graphical editor defined with ((Sirius))
(See <<defining-a-concrete-syntax-with-sirius-section>> for more details about ((Sirius)).) which represents 
the current instruction and provides commands to enable/disable breakpoints.
This layer is activated when the model is executed in *Debug mode*.

NOTE: The Debug layer role is similar to the services of a text editor that highlights the current line of the selected Step 
in the stack frame and offer to toggle breakpoints.

TIP: Additionally, the editor may also present the RunTime Data in this layer, but usually, a better design would separate the task of  
RTD presentation in another Animation layer as the animation is supposed to be also displayed in Run mode. 
(See <<define-sirus-animation-representation-section>>) 

  
This section covers the debug representation creation wizard and the technical implementation details. Technical implementation details are only useful for advanced use case and troubleshooting.

===== The debug representation wizard
This wizard creates a layer to represent the current instruction and add commands in order to manage breakpoints and launch a simulation in debug mode. This is a default implementation, it can be customized to represent runtime data for instance. The customization uses the ((Sirius)) description definition, see the http://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/specifier/Sirius%20Specifier%20Manual.html[Sirius Specifier Manual] for more details.
The wizard presents three ways to implement this layer:

* Create a debug diagram description
* Extend an existing diagram description
* Add a debug layer to an existing diagram description

====== Create a debug diagram description
It creates a diagram representation with a default debug layer. The representation does not depend on another representation. A typical use case is a language where the runtime data representation is too far from the language graphical syntax.

====== Extend an existing diagram description
It creates a diagram representation with a default debug layer that extends an existing representation. This allows to have a debug layer based on the representation of the language concrete syntax. The language concrete syntax can be deployed without the debug representation. A typical use case is the reuse of an existing diagram definition that you cannot modify by yourself. For instance if you want to use http://eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=uml2[UML], you can reuse the http://www.umldesigner.org/[UML Designer].

You can select any diagram description.

And then define the new diagram description which extends the one you previously selected.

====== Add a debug layer to an existing diagram description
It creates a default debug layer in an existing diagram representation. This should be used if you are also in charge of the language concrete syntax.

In this case, you can only select a diagram description from the workspace.

===== Implementation details
Implementation details are for advanced use and troubleshooting. It explains how the implementation works behind the scene. There are two main elements covered here : the debugger services class and the debug layer itself.

====== Debugger services
The debugger services class is use to tell which representations should be activated and refreshed during debug (see the getRepresentationRefreshList() method). It also provides a method to know if an element of the diagram is the current instruction. This is provided by the isCurrentInstruction() method.

[IMPORTANT]
====

The line `res.add(new StringCouple("DD_or_RN", "LAYER_ID"));` indicates
which layers are part of the "debug" animation. Ie. if these layers must be activated automatically
and updated when an execution is in debug mode.

The way to indicate the layer depends on how you have created the layer:

*  in case of a single odesign with all layers in a single viewpoint:
** the first String _DD_or_RN_ is the _id_ of the Diagram Description
** the second String _LAYER_ID_ is the _id_ of the Layer
*	in case of a diagram extension:
** the first String _DD_or_RN_ is the _Representation Name_ of the Diagram Extension (do not confuse with the Name !!)
** the second String _LAYER_ID_ is the _id_ of the Layer

====

====== Debug layer
The default debug layer adds action to start the simulation in debug mode and to toggle breakpoints (1). When a breakpoint exists for an element of the diagram, a visual feedback is displayed according to the breakpoint state (2). The current instruction is also highlighted in yellow by default (3).

This is a default debug layer, it can be customized to fit your needs. The customization use the ((Sirius)) description definition, see the http://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/specifier/Sirius%20Specifier%20Manual.html[Sirius Specifier Manual] for more details.

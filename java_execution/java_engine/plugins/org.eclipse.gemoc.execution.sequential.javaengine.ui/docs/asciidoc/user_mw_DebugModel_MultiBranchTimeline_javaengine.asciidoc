===== Multibranch timeline view

====== Java engine specific support for multibranch timeline

As the Java engine doesn't offer execution branches (no possible concurrent actions), 
all commands related to branches are disabled  and the timeline will allow to display 
only a straight line.

[WARNING]
====
When going backward then forward again using the <<userguide-sequential-launch-conf , Java Engine>>, 
the execution is a kind of `replay` where only the model is updated. The DSA 
operations are *not* run.  
The DSA will run again normally when the engine will try to run the last recorded 
Step in the timeline.
